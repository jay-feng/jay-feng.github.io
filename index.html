  <h1>Jay Feng</h1>
  <h3>Some web design related things I've worked on:</h3>
  <p><a target="_blank" href="https://jay-feng.github.io/plastic-waste">Plastic Waste Website</a>
     - an interactive website to help users learn how to
    dispose of different kinds of plastic waste
   </p>
  <p><a target="_blank" href="https://jay-feng.github.io/whsvolunteer">Student Volunteer opportunities</a>
     - a website where students could post and search for local volunteer opportunities
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>mostly made for web design/development practice, would have to setup some
    sort of backend to actually work :)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><a target="_blank" href="https://publiceditor.io/">Public Editor Website</a>
     - rebuilt the website for the Public Editor project, which aims to generate credibility
     scores on news articles to combat fake news
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>designed by me, aside from the illustrations and graphics</li>
    <li>built using Squarespace ( :') ) to meet launch deadline and help non-technical people
      create blog posts more easily</li>
    <li>added HTML elements and touched up styling with CSS
  </ul>
